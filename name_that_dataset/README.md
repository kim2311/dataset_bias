These scripts will generate the confusion matrices for our implementation of the *Name That Dataset* experiment. Our results can be seen by running the respective `results*.py` scripts.

To simulate the experiment with the datasets on the HELPS machine, run the respective `main` script:
`python ntd_main.py`

The `calc` and `results` scripts are for generating the averaged and normalized results over a series of iterations. The data must be input manually.
